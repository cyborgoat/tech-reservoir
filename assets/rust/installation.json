Rust emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. Rust enforces memory safety\u2014that is, that all references point to valid memory\u2014without requiring the use of a garbage collector or reference counting present in other memory-safe languages.\n\nThis article goes through how to install cargo on you local machine and tutorial on mirror settings if you are located in China.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe official Rust document website is [https://www.rust-lang.org/](https://www.rust-lang.org/)\n\n### Rustup: the Rust installer and version management tool\n\nThe primary way that folks install Rust is through a tool called Rustup, which is a Rust installer and version management tool.\n\nIt looks like you\u2019re running macOS, Linux, or another Unix-like OS. To download Rustup and install Rust, run the following in your terminal, then follow the on-screen instructions. See \"Other Installation Methods\" if you are on Windows.\n\n```bash\ncurl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh\n```\n\nIf you need to update your Rust, you can simply enter `rustup update`.\n\n### Mirror settings for users in China\n\n1. Go to folder  `/Users/{yourname}/.cargo/` (create one if you don't have it yet)\n2. Create a file named `config.toml`\n3. Add the following content to `config.toml`\n\n```toml\n[source.crates-io]\n# Specify the mirror\nreplace-with = 'tuna' # You can replace tuna by ustc or sjtu or rustcc\n\n# \u4e2d\u56fd\u79d1\u5b66\u6280\u672f\u5927\u5b66\n[source.ustc]\nregistry = \"git://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/crates.io-index\"\n\n# \u4e0a\u6d77\u4ea4\u901a\u5927\u5b66\n[source.sjtu]\nregistry = \"https://mirrors.sjtug.sjtu.edu.cn/git/crates.io-index\"\n\n# \u6e05\u534e\u5927\u5b66\n[source.tuna]\nregistry = \"https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/git/crates.io-index.git\"\n\n# rustcc\u793e\u533a\n[source.rustcc]\nregistry = \"https://code.aliyun.com/rustcc/crates.io-index.git\"\n```\n"}
