Please note that if you created SSH keys previously, ssh-keygen may ask you to rewrite another key, in which case we recommend creating a custom-named SSH key. To do so, type the default file location and replace id_ssh_keyname with your custom key name.\n\n```bash\n> Enter a file in which to save the key (/home/YOU/.ssh/ALGORITHM):[Press enter]\n```\n\nAt the prompt, type a secure passphrase.\n\n```bash\n> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]\n> Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]\n```\n\n## Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent\n\nBefore adding a new SSH key to the ssh-agent to manage your keys, you should have checked for existing SSH keys and generated a new SSH key.\n\n```bash\n$ eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\n> Agent pid 59566\n```\n\nDepending on your environment, you may need to use a different command. For example, you may need to use root access by running sudo -s -H before starting the ssh-agent, or you may need to use exec ssh-agent bash or exec ssh-agent zsh to run the ssh-agent.\n\nAdd your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_ed25519 in the command with the name of your private key file.\n\n```bash\n$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n```\n\nAdd the SSH key to your account on GitHub."}
