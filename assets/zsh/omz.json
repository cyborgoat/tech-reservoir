Make sure either of one utility is installed in the OS, if not install them along with git by running the following `apt` command.\n\n```bash\n$ sudo apt install curl wget git\n```\n\nThen we install `zsh` by,\n\n```bash\n$ sudo apt install zsh\n```\n\nMake sure `zsh` is correctly installed,\n\n```bash\n$ zsh --version\n```\n\nInstalling ZSH will not modify and set it as the default shell. We have to modify the settings to make ZSH our default shell. Use the \u201cchsh\u201d command with '-s' flag to switch the default shell for the user.\n\n```bash\n$ echo $SHELL\n$ chsh -s $(which zsh) \nor \n$ chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh\n```\n\nNext, install **Oh My Zsh** via the command-line with either curl or wget as shown.\n\n```bash\n$ sh -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)\"\n```\n\nor,\n\n```bash\n$ sh -c \"$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)\"\n```\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully installed Oh My Zsh on your ubuntu machine!\n"}
