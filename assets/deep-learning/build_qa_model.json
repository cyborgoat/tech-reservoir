As one of the most comprehensive Q&A datasets available, it's only natural that we will be making use of it. So let's explore it.\n\nFirst, we'll need to download the data. There are two JSON files that we are interested in - train and dev, which we can downloaded from http. Here we will be storing the SQuAD data in the `data/squad` directory, so we must check if this already exists and if not create the directory.\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nsquad_dir = './data/squad'\n\nif not os.path.exists(squad_dir):\n    os.mkdir(squad_dir)\n```\n\n```python\nurl = 'https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/dataset/'\nfiles = ['train-v2.0.json', 'dev-v2.0.json']\n```\n\n```python\n# Download data to local machine\nimport requests\n\nfor file in files:\n    res = requests.get(url+file)\n    # write to file in chunks\n    with open(os.path.join(squad_dir, file), 'wb') as f:\n        for chunk in res.iter_content(chunk_size=40):\n            f.write(chunk)\n```\n\n```python\n\nimport json\n\nwith open(os.path.join(squad_dir, 'train-v2.0.json'), 'rb') as f:\n    squad = json.load(f)\n```\n\nThe JSON structure contains a top-level 'data' key which contains a list of groups, where each group is a topic, such as Beyonce, Chopin, or Matter. We can take a look at the first and last groups respectively.\n\n```python\n# squad['data'][0]\n```\n\n```python\nsquad['data'][-1]['paragraphs'][0]\n```\n\n    {'qas': [{'plausible_answers': [{'text': 'ordinary matter composed of atoms',\n         'answer_start': 50}],\n       'question': 'What did the term matter include after the 20th century?',\n       'id': '5a7db48670df9f001a87505f',\n       'answers': [],\n       'is_impossible': True},\n      {'plausible_answers': [{'text': 'matter', 'answer_start': 59}],\n       'question': 'What are atoms composed of?',\n       'id': '5a7db48670df9f001a875060',\n       'answers': [],\n       'is_impossible': True},\n      {'plausible_answers': [{'text': 'light or sound', 'answer_start': 128}],\n       'question': 'What are two examples of matter?',\n       'id': '5a7db48670df9f001a875061',\n       'answers': [],\n       'is_impossible': True},\n      {'plausible_answers': [{'text': \"its (possibly massless) constituents' motion and interaction energies\",\n         'answer_start': 315}],\n       'question': \"What can an object's mass not come from?\",\n       'id': '5a7db48670df9f001a875062',\n       'answers': [],\n       'is_impossible': True},\n      {'plausible_answers': [{'text': 'fundamental', 'answer_start': 449}],\n       'question': 'Matter is currently considered to be what kind of concept?',\n       'id': '5a7db48670df9f001a875063',\n       'answers': [],\n       'is_impossible': True}],\n     'context': \"Before the 20th century, the term matter included ordinary matter composed of atoms and excluded other energy phenomena such as light or sound. This concept of matter may be generalized from atoms to include any objects having mass even when at rest, but this is ill-defined because an object's mass can arise from its (possibly massless) constituents' motion and interaction energies. Thus, matter does not have a universal definition, nor is it a fundamental concept in physics today. Matter is also used loosely as a general term for the substance that makes up all observable physical objects.\"}\n\nIf we compare the first entry on Beyonce and the second on Matter, we can see that we sometimes return our answers in the `answers` key, and sometimes in the `plausible_answers` key. So when processing this data we will need to consider some additional logic to deal with this.\n\nSecondly, for all samples, we need to iterate through multiple levels. On the highest level we have groups, which is where our topics like 'Beyonce' and 'Matter' belong. At the next layer we have paragraphs, and in the next we have our question-answer pairs, this structure looks like this:\n\nWe'll work through parsing this data into a cleaner format that we will be using in later notebooks. We need to create a format that consists of a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains a single question, answer, and context.\n\n```python\n# initialize list where we will place all of our data\nnew_squad = []\n\n# we need to loop through groups -> paragraphs -> qa_pairs\nfor group in squad['data']:\n    for paragraph in group['paragraphs']:\n        # we pull out the context from here\n        context = paragraph['context']\n        for qa_pair in paragraph['qas']:\n            # we pull out the question\n            question = qa_pair['question']\n            # now the logic to check if we have 'answers' or 'plausible_answers'\n            if 'answers' in qa_pair.keys() and len(qa_pair['answers']) > 0:\n                answer = qa_pair['answers'][0]['text']\n            elif 'plausible_answers' in qa_pair.keys() and len(qa_pair['plausible_answers']) > 0:\n                answer = qa_pair['plausible_answers'][0]['text']\n            else:\n                # this shouldn't happen, but just in case we just set answer = None\n                answer = None\n            # append dictionary sample to parsed squad\n            new_squad.append({\n                'question': question,\n                'answer': answer,\n                'context': context\n            })\n```\n\n```python\nnew_squad[:2], new_squad[-2:]\n```\n\n    ([{'question': 'When did Beyonce start becoming popular?',\n       'answer': 'in the late 1990s',\n       'context': 'Beyonc\u00e9 Giselle Knowles-Carter (/bi\u02d0\u02c8j\u0252nse\u026a/ bee-YON-say) (born September 4, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer and actress.

A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years.
