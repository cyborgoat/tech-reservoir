At the time of writing, the version in the repositories is 10.19. This will not be the latest version, but it should be stable and sufficient for quick experimentation with the language.\n\nTo get this version, you can use the apt package manager. Refresh your local package index first:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update\n```\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install nodejs\n```\n\nCheck that the install was successful by querying node for its version number:\n\n```bash\n$ node -v\n> v10.19.0\n```\n\nIf the package in the repositories suits your needs, this is all you need to do to get set up with Node.js. In most cases, you\u2019ll also want to also install npm, the Node.js package manager. You can do this by installing the npm package with apt:\n\n```bash\n$ sudo apt install npm\n```\n\nThis allows you to install modules and packages to use with Node.js.\n\nAt this point, you have successfully installed Node.js and npm using apt and the default Ubuntu software repositories. The next section will show how to use an alternate repository to install different versions of Node.js.\n\n## Mirror Setting\n\nFor users in China, please add the following mirror settings to make sure your `npm` running as expected\n\n```bash\nnpm config set registry https://registry.npmirror.com\n```\n"}
